# OwlHack-2021
This contains all of the code and images for my submission. [home.html](https://github.com/MaximusOpus/OwlHack-2021/blob/main/OwlHack2021/home.html) contains the home starting page. Since I used PHP and MySQL, a local server is needed to run the website. [owlhack2021.sql](https://github.com/MaximusOpus/OwlHack-2021/blob/main/OwlHack2021/owlhack2021.sql) will have to be imported into an MySQL database for the website to work properly. 

Happy reading!
