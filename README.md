# OwlHack-2021
This contains all of the code and images for my submission. [home.html](http://github.com) contains the home starting page. Since I used PHP and MySQL, a local server is needed to run the website. The owlhack2021.sql will have to be imported into an MySQL database for the website to work properly. 

Happy reading!
